Causal Inference understand the cause probability theory statistics: causality-free enterprise, paused to ask why? correlation is not causation… but statistics don’t say what is causation Sewall Wright and the invention of Path Analysis This ‘era’ with the presumption that Big Data is the solution to all our problem Data is profoundly dumb Causal Revolution: scientific shakeup that embrace our innate cognitive gift of understanding cause and effect One of the crowning of the causal revolution has been to explain how to predict the effects of an intervention without e nacting it. #Counterfactual: retrospective thinking (what if …? | would he …? etc.) and algorithmization in computer science. Counterfactuals are not the products of whimsy but reflect the very structure of our world. Counterfactuals are the building blocks of moral behavior as well as scientific thought. The ability to reflect on one’s past actions and envision alternative scenarios is the basis of ‘free will’ and social responsibility. Block to human-thinking machines is the lack of understand of causal relations . | The calculus of causation has 2 languages: | !? | . | #causal-diagram | what we know | . | #symbolic-language similar to algebra | what we don’t know | . $P(L | do(D))$ read as: Probability of Lifespan expectancy if someone is taking the Drug . The inference engine is a machine that accepts three different kinds of inputs: . | Assumptions | Queries | Data | . All the data is anyway a finite sample from a theoretically infinite population. We collect Data only after we posit the causal model, after we state the scientific query we wish ti answer, and after we derive the estimand. #Data-Mining and #deep-learning are lacking in adaptability, not causal models.

On Saturday, you solved 77 out of 88 attempted problems, but your friend solved 22 out of 2.2. You had solved more problems, but your friend pointed out that he was more accurate, since 7/8 &lt; 2/2. Fair enough. On Sunday, you only attempted 22 problems and got 11 correct. Your friend got 55 out of 88 problems correct. Your friend gloated once again, since 1/2 &lt; 5/8. However, the competition is about the one who solved more accurately over the weekend, not on individual days. Overall, you have solved 88 out of 1010 problems whereas your friend has solved 77 out of 1010 problems. Thus, despite your friend solving a higher proportion of problems on each day, you actually won the challenge by solving the higher proportion for the entire weekend! While your friend got furious, you calmly pointed him to this page: you had just shown an instance of Simpson's paradox. Social phenomena are much less predictable thaN physical phenomena. ",
