- Compact layouts control which fields your users see in the highlights panel at the top of a record.

- They also control the fields that appear in the expanded lookup card you see when you hover over a link in record details, and in the details section when you expand an activity in the activity timeline.

2. add it to the Page-Layouts:
      Quick Actions is for the Classic and 
      Mobile & Lightning Actions is for Lightning experience.
      ![](dendron-template/assets/images/2020-12-22-21-02-32.png)
   \-> select the Page Layout you want the action be added 
   \-> drag & drop the action where you want to see it

Create a Global Action:
 It lets users create a **_object-record_** no matter where they are in Salesforce. A global action is an ideal way to do this, because the global actions menu appears at the top of every page.

1. setup -> #Global-Actions ...
2. add the action:
   ```
   - go to: #Publisher-Layouts -> edit -> drag & drop

There's 2 types: #one-to-one and #one-to-many.

==#Master-detail-relationship are 'tighter' relationship.==
The master object controls certain behaviors of the detail object, like who can view the detail’s data.
The detail object highly dependent on the master. In fact, if a record on the master object is deleted, all its related detail records are deleted as well. 
In a #Master-detail-relationship the Master is always a #Standard-object and the detail is the #Custom-object.
The field is added always on the master side of the #Master-detail-relationship

Picklists are menus that expand to give users choices.

1. **Standard**: the ones that are included in your Salesforce org before any customization.
2. **Custom**: the one you create to have custom picklist's behaviour
3. **Custom Multi-Select**: if you want the user be able to select more than one value
   and fields can have those properties:

- \#**Restricted-picklists** : doesn't let you add new values, even with APIs, the idea is to create consistency
- **#Dependent** or **#Controlling**: it's based on a selection from another picklist or a checkbox (the controlling value) on the same record

  |                                   | Standard Picklist  | Custom Picklist    | Custom Multi-Select Picklist |                    |

</summary>

\#Global-set-value(s) are always #restricted and let you share the same picklist values with more than one picklist field.

Two ways to use it:

| Matching rule  | The matching criteria to identify duplicate records.Salesforce comes with three standard matching rules: one for business accounts; one for contacts and leads, and another for person accounts. Creating other matching rules is a cinch. We show you how Maria does it in the next unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Duplicate rule | When Salesforce engages matching rules and determines actions to take as it encounters duplicates.Depending on how you configure Duplicate Management, sales reps see an alert that they’re about to create a duplicate. Or your reps are blocked from creating the duplicate altogether. If your company started using Salesforce in Spring ’15 or later, we give you standard duplicate rules for business accounts, contacts, leads, and person accounts. If your company started using Salesforce in Winter ’15 or earlier, like Maria, you create the rules on your own, which is easy. |

You can create a #Report in order to check for duplicate records.
\#Setup -> #Report-types -> ... -> select as #Primary-object the #Duplicate-record-items/#Duplicate-record-sets

### [Data Security](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/data_security?trailmix_creator_id=strailhead&trailmix_slug=prepare-for-your-salesforce-platform-app-builder-credential)

<details><summary>
Which are the levels of Data Access? 
</summary>

1. Organization -> auth users, password policies, location and hours login limits, trusted IP ranges (using #Profile)
2. Objects: setting permission on an object, from #Profile or #Permission-sets
3. Fields: restrict level access
4. Records: record access determines which individual records users can view and edit in each object they have access to in their profile. First ask yourself these questions:

- Should your users have open access to every record, or just a subset?
- If it’s a subset, what rules should determine whether the user can access them?

You control record-level access in four ways.

```
- #Organization-wide-defaults
- #role-hierarchy
- #sharing-rules: found at #setup->#Security->#Sharing-Settings.
    You need to define a #Public-group
    - #Private
    - #Public-Read-Only
    - #Public-Read-write
    - #Controlled-by-Parent
- #manual-sharing
```

![\#security-map](dendron-template/assets/images/2020-10-23-09-42-41.png)

Changes in Security can be tracked in the Audit section:

1. \#SAML: is the protocol that allow #SSO (When you want users to move seamlessly between Salesforce orgs and applications without logging in repeatedly). It's an #XML-based protocol
2. \#OAuth 2.0 , allow secure data sharing between applications
3. OpenID Connect, #OpenID-Connect is protocol that adds an authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0 to enable secure exchange of user information.

| Authentication means who a person is.

| The first element in the flow isn't a screen.The power of a flow is that it can do a lot of things behind the scenes, with the user none the wiser. But that can also make the flow a little bit dangerous, especially if it does those powerful, behind-the-scenes things before the first screen. | You built a flow that creates a task before displaying a screen to the user. If you put that flow on, say, the Account page, that flow would create a task every time a user loaded an account. That could result in lots of unnecessary tasks being created each day. |
| The flow isn't used often enough to be expanded by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | You created a flow for your office managers to order new supplies. The office managers need to be able to access that flow easily, but they don't need to order supplies every day, so it would be a waste of space to put the flow directly on a record page.         |

<details><summary>
Where Flow can be added if needed on more records?
</summary>

If flow needs to be added from more than 1 record, you can add it to the #utility-bar,
It's only on all pages of 1 App.

</details>

<details><summary>
Can I add the Flow outside of Salesforce Org?
</summary>

1. Yes, You can add it to the a Salesforce Lightning #Community on:
   - Surveys
   - Registration forms
   - Interest forms
   - Quote generators, such as for a car they're selling
2. You can add it to a external app using #Lightning-out, but first enable Communities in Setup.

If you add a related object, here’s how you can configure a report type’s object relationship:

- Primary object with related object—Records
- Primary object with or without related object

==We have 2 Report types:==

- Standard (ready-made so you don't need to do nothing but choose on wich obj/obj combo) ==with==
- Custom (setup -> Feature Serttings -> Analytics -> Reports and Dashboards -> Report Types) ==with or without== in add to the 1ry obj, you can add till 3 rel objs |(4 levels)

What are dynamic dashboards?
</summary>

- With dynamic dashboards, each user sees the data they have access to without needing to create separate dashboards for each user.
- This means a single powerful dashboard can be used for multiple users in your company, because the logged-in user viewing the dashboard sees the data they should see, based on their security and sharing settings.
