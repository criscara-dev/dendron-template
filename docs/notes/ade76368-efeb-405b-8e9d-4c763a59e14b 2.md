# Test Classes

## Rules

One test class for trigger

Overview of test classes:
Apex code that test Apex code.
From manual steps:

1. create or modify test records
2. force trigger to execute
3. verify the result  
   To robots (test classes) that automate this job 

Why are test classes important?
Let you write code that not break SF servers.
Requirements of test classes 

Demo time: 

- HelloWorld test class
- AppleWatch test class 
  How Salesforce calculates test coverage 
  The Four Commandments 
  Demo: DedupeReminder test class

## How to write a test class:

==1. mimic how you'd manually test code==
==2. create all data from scratch, trying to avoid ~~SeeAllData=true~~==
Ex.

1. determine when the trigger is running ...insert?...update? is Update so,
   (you need to create records for the trigger to test since in @isTest the database is empty; is clean up automagically after the test has run )
2. create a method that create the data and update the record
