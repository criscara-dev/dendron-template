# Web services

## Web Services

To make a Class available for web services just make it _**global**_ and create a _**global static**_   method;

## Process of building an Apex REST service

- [ ] create the Apex class that is exposed as a REST service

| Annotation  | Action | Details                                                      |
| :---------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| @HttpGet    | read   | Reads or retrieves records                                   |
| @HttpPost   | create | Creates records                                              |
| @HttpDelete | delete | Deletes records.                                             |
| @HttpPut    | upsert | Typically used to update existing records or create records. |
| @HttpPatch  | update | Typically used to update fields in existing records.         |

- [ ] try calling a few methods from a client:
  ex. post call from workbench:
  ![](/assets/images/2020-10-14-10-37-00.png)
  ex. get call:
  ![](/assets/images/2020-10-14-10-39-45.png)
  ex. upsert operation:
  ![](/assets/images/2020-10-14-10-46-32.png)
  ex. update action or 'patch':
  ![](/assets/images/2020-10-14-10-59-12.png)

- [ ] write unit tests

- if you are working on web services on Managed Packages, oyu need the - #namespace in Apex REST endpoints, so the rul should look like this:
  `https://instance.salesforce.com/services/apexrest/packageNamespace/MyMethod/`
- About #security, Apex web service methods enforce sharing rules when declared with the with sharing keyword.
