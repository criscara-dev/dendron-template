## APIs and API first Approach

- [Rest Api](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/api_basics/api_basics_rest)
- [Soap Api](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/api_basics/api_basics_soap)
- [Bulk Api](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/api_basics/api_basics_bulk)
- [Streaming Api](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/api_basics/api_basics_streaming)

### Rest API

A REST request consists of four components:

- a resource URI
- an HTTP method
- request headers
- a request body

* * *

### SOAP API

#### terms:

- Web Services Description Language (WSDL) 
- Web Services Connector (WSC)
  Enable it:
- [ ] setup -> API -> and download the file
- [ ] use [SoapUI](https://www.soapui.org/downloads/soapui/) to consume our enterprise WSDL file.

* * *

### BULK API

[Trailhead bulk API](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/api_basics/api_basics_bulk), condensed here:
Based on asynchronous REST.

- [ ] to create a job using the URI: /services/data/v XX.0/jobs/ingest  - and for the POST http method and add this req body:

- [ ] add data to a job (PUT http method): /services/data/v XX.0/jobs/ingest/ jobID/batches where jobID is found on result from workbench Post request.
  check header and set to this since importing from CSV: Content-Type: text/csv
  The job can be lookup in Setup -> ... -> Bulk Data Load Jobs
  You should geta 201 response

- [ ] now we need to let SF know we want to process the data (PATCH http method): go to this URI: /services/data/v XX.0/jobs/ingest/\*jobID and add a request body:
  {
     "state" : "UploadComplete"
  }
  and reset Headers to: Content-Type to application/json
  You should get a 200 status code.

- [ ] to check any failed results use a GET (http method) at this URI: /services/data/v XX.0/jobs/ingest/\*jobID/failedResults

* * *

### Streaning API

A PushTopic is an sObject that contains the criteria of events you want to listen to.
|NotifyForFields  Value|Description|
\|--- \|--- \|
|All|Notifications are generated for all record field changes, provided the evaluated records match the criteria specified in the WHERE clause.|
|Referenced (default)|Changes to fields referenced in the SELECT and WHERE clauses are evaluated. Notifications are generated for the evaluated records only if they match the criteria specified in the WHERE clause.|
|Select|Changes to fields referenced in the SELECT clause are evaluated. Notifications are generated for the evaluated records only if they match the criteria specified in the WHERE clause.|
|Where|Changes to fields referenced in the WHERE clause are evaluated. Notifications are generated for the evaluated records only if they match the criteria specified in the WHERE clause.|

Plublish platform events:

- Process Builder using the Create a Record action
- Flow using a Create Records element
- Apex EventBus.publish() method
- REST API sobjects resource
- SOAP API create() call
