Abstract Boolean logic
</summary>

You can manipulate Boolean Expressions like arithmetic expressions

<details><summary>
AND
</summary>

| x | y | AND |
| - | - | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0   |
| 0 | 1 | 0   |
| 1 | 0 | 0   |
| 1 | 1 | 1   |

</details>

<details><summary>
OR
</summary>

| x | y | OR |
| - | - | -- |
| 0 | 0 | 0  |
| 0 | 1 | 1  |
| 1 | 0 | 1  |
| 1 | 1 | 1  |

<details><summary>
NOT

Construct Boolean function?
We want to build a computer, so we need to go from Truth table to Boolean expression.
In fact, any Boolean function can be represented using an expression containing AND, ~~OR~~ and NOT operations.
We can use the #Morgan-Law to avoid using OR:
Proof:
(x OR y) = NOT(NOT(x) AND NOT(y))

<details><summary>
With which expression we can do everything?
</summary>

NOT AND or -> NAND
x|y|NAND
\-\|-\|-
0|0|1
0|1|1
1|0|1
1|1|0

and that lead to the Theorem:
Any Boolean function can be represented using an expression containing only ==NAND== operations.

Proof:
1) NOT(x)= (x NAND x)
2) (x AND y) = NOT(x NAND y)

How can you implement a circuit?

Both need to be true in order to light up the bulb.
Or this:

With OR logic we just need one port.

</details>

<details><summary>
Which of these statements are true?
</summary>

- [x] The chip interface describes what the chip is doing; the chip implementation specifies how the chip is doing it.
- [ ] There is only one possible implementation for every interface.
- [x] The user of the chip is interested in the chip interface; the builder of the chip is interested in the chip implementation.

## Multi-bit Buses

<details><summary>
How would you xor the first and last bits of a 16-bit bus named ‘bus’?
</summary>

- [ ] Xor(a=bus[0], b=bus[15], out=out)[^1]
- [ ] Xor(a=bus[0], b=bus[16], out=out)
- [ ] Xor(a=bus[1], b=bus[15], out=out)
- [ ] Xor(a=bus[1], b=bus[16], out=out)

[^1]&#x3A; Bus numbers start from 0 and go up to width-1

</details>

<details><summary>
This is the interface declaration for an example chip named Example16, which we haven't discussed before:
IN c, Bus1[16], Bus2[16];
OUT out, out2[16];
Which of these lines are valid in HDL, when implementing the Example16 chip?
</summary>

- [ ] Add16(a=Bus1[0..15], b=Bus2[0..15], out=out2[0..14]);
- [ ] Add16(a=Bus1[0..15], b=Bus2[0..15], out[0..14]=out2[0..14]);[^2]
- [ ] Add16(a=true, b=false, out=out2);[^2]
- [ ] Add16(a=c, b=Bus2[0..15], out=out2);
- [ ] And(a=c, b=Bus2[7], out=out);[^2]
