# The book of why

### Summary

You are smarter than your data. Data do not understand causes and effects; humans do. 

### Preface

Causal Inference
understand the cause
probability theory
statistics: causality-free enterprise, paused to ask why?
correlation is not causation... but statistics don't say what is causation
Sewall Wright and the invention of Path Analysis
This 'era' with the presumption that Big Data is the solution to all our problem
Data is profoundly dumb
Causal Revolution: scientific shakeup that embrace our innate cognitive gift of understanding cause and effect
One of the crowning of the causal revolution has been to explain how to predict the effects of an intervention without e nacting it.
 \#Counterfactual: retrospective thinking (what if ...? | would he ...? etc.) and algorithmization in computer science.
Counterfactuals are not the products of whimsy but reflect the very structure of our world. 
Counterfactuals are the building blocks of moral behavior as well as scientific thought. The ability to reflect on one's past actions and envision alternative scenarios is the basis of 'free will' and social responsibility.
Block to human-thinking machines is the lack of understand of causal relations

 The inference engine is a machine that accepts three different kinds of inputs:

1. Assumptions
2. Queries
3. Data

All the data is anyway a finite sample from a theoretically infinite population.

> We collect Data only after we posit the causal model, after we state the scientific query we wish ti answer, and after we derive the estimand.

 \#Data-Mining and #deep-learning are lacking in adaptability, not causal models.
Fit a function to data, that all deep learning can do.

This book -> become a proficient causal reasoner.
