### Flexcards Overview: VPE 3-0


#### What FlexCard are and what they can do?
**FlexCards summarize contextual information at a glance.**
- Most FlexCards provide this combination of **information** and **actions**.
**FlexCards are the beginning and ending point for customer transactions**
**We can view FlexCards on any device or channel**
**A FlexCard can display data from multiple data sources**
**We build FlexCards quickly using drag and drop elements** (Within OmniStudio)
**FlexCards have a WYSIWYG editor for controlling their layout and style**
**FlexCard Actions are relevant to the context of the card**
- id est (that is), Update Case action opens a second tab for the Update Case Details guided interaction, which is an LWC OmniScript.
**FlexCards are reusable and embeddable in other FlexCards** (a.k.a. Child FlexCards)
**FlexCards display more detail on demand with Flyouts**
- A Flyout is another FlexCard that appears when you click an action on a FlexCard. A Flyout displays:
additional of secondary information
**FlexCards have multiple states that display based on conditions**
- i.e., a _FlexCard state_ determines what the user **can see and do** on the card.
**We can embed a FlexCard inside an OmniScript**
Obviously, the action that start has a visual UI... i.e. a a FlexCard in a LWC OmniScript


#### Which are the building elements currently available in the FlexCard Designer?

Simple UI elements include: | The more advanced UI elements are: 
--|--
Action | Chart
Block | Custom LWC
Field | Datatable
Icon | FlexCard
Image | State
Menu | &nbsp;
Text | &nbsp;
Toggle | &nbsp;
</details>

#### VPE 3-4
Basically I notice the documentation is well organized, how my work should.

make a schema of how I have to proceed.

- Review:
Confirm your understanding by answering these questions.
• What is a benefit of bringing in external data like the Weather to your FlexCard?
-> to help the agent to assess the condition for the intervention...
• How can you pull an image into a card for display?
-> via URL or file upload or... just click the question mark for the tooltip!
• What weather data are you bringing into your FlexCard?
-> The current Condition, temperature and Location/city

Review
Confirm your understanding by answering these questions.
• What is an advantage of using a datatable to display information?
-> see data in a table format
• What is a flyout and how might you use one?
-> It's an `action` it let open another FlexCard/URL from int/ext site to get more date what otherwise will make everything to cluttered
• How do you create a flyout?
From the `properties` of a FlexCard in Action type
• Why might you not be able to view a flyout in a FlexCard?
-> ==because is not set in `action type?==
• Can you embed a child FlexCard in another child FlexCard?
-> Yes
• What is the Repeat Records feature and why must it be disabled for a datatable?
-> in Vlocity, Datatables already loop over list of records.
`Repeat Records` loops as well over list for multiple records, so disable it. 

> Best Practices
BEST PRACTICES
FlexCard state display top to bottom.
The first state that has true conditions displays.
A a best practice, always keep a card state at the bottom that hasn't any conditions. This card becomes the default card state when no conditions are met.

## VPE-4 Key Capabilities of Vlocity OmniScripts

### VPE 4-0 Overview

<details><summary>
More simple, what is an OmniScript?
</summary>
A way for a person to complete a business process.
3 Steps:
* Get data
* Change Data
* Save Data
</details>

<details><summary>
What is a A Vlocity OmniScript?
</summary>

1. A Vlocity OmniScript is declarative scripting tool that behave as a guided path to complete a business process.
Basically is a way to complete business processes digitally
2. An OmniScript displays both internal data from Salesforce and external data from a website or a 3rd-party legacy system. (AOIs)
3. We rebrand OmniScripts to suit our customers
4. We use OmniScripts to manage signed documents (and we can create dynamic documents with Vlocity from templates)
</details>

<details><summary>
Example of Omniscript?
</summary>
A customer service agent adds a new customer and captures details for a service implementation, such as network configuration requirements
A customer steps through a selling process, such as choosing a new insurance plan
An insurance agent updates a policy
A customer completes a self-service interaction such as troubleshooting a service outage
A customer completes forms for different services, such as government benefits, insurance policies, and healthcare coverage
</details>

![](/assets/images/2021-02-08-12-11-19.png)

<details><summary>
What are OmniOut and CardOut?
</summary>
The capability of hosting OmniScripts and FlexCards on any server is called OmniOut and CardOut.
</details>

### VPE 4-1 Guidelines for Planning OmniScripts

* Map the business process to the proposed OmniScript structure. It's easier to make edits to your process before you begin building.
* Plan what data is involved and where it is needed. This tells you what data must be available for each guided step.
* Decide what data you want to gather and where to save it.

Outline the flow: **Data Process** and **Agent actions**

<details><summary>
What makes each OmniScript unique?
</summary>
Type, Subtype, and Language define the unique identity of the OmniScript
Only one active OmniScript may have the same Type, Subtype, and Language at any time.
The Name is required, but does not have to be unique.
Type must start with a lower case letter.
Use PascalCase...not camelCase
</details>

### VPE 4-2 Getting Salesforce Data for the OmniScript

- When an OmniScript is launched from a Card, the **RecordId** for the card is passed to the OmniScript where it is stored in a variable called **ContextId**.

[VPE 4-2 Review Questions](https://vlocity-university.litmos.com/course/3108510/module/6580385/Scorm?LPId=104370)
• What are the advantages of using Vlocity Integration Procedures as data sources?
-> They can be versioned, so when updated, you don’t have to change your OmniScript or Card configuration. (e.g. Stub data to live data)
Multiple DataSources (SF, API, Apex) can be combined in one server call.

• Why did you use the same value in the Name and Field Label of the Integration Procedure?
->However best practice when working with LWC is to enter the name in the Field Label. This is because the field label does display in the Action Debugger. Later, when you configure multiple integration procedures, **having descriptive labels** for them helps you confirm if they are pulling and pushing the data correctly.

• What determines the JSON structure of an OmniScript?
-> Aside from the header data, the structure of OmniScript elements determines the JSON structure of an OmniScript.

• How does an OmniScript match incoming data with elements?
-> **OmniScripts have a parser that matches incoming data with the elements based on the element name**. To populate the fields in the UI, you need to change the element names to match the input field names from the Integration Procedure by adding “Account” to the beginning of each element name. 

• Why did we update the mask?
-> Remove the mask as the phone number does not display in a Lightning web component with a mask in place.
