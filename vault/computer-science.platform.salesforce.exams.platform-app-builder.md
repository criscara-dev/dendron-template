### [Data Modeling](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/data_modeling?trailmix_creator_id=strailhead&trailmix_slug=prepare-for-your-salesforce-platform-app-builder-credential)

<details><summary>
What's a #Data-model?
</summary>
It's a representation of data in a way that make sense at humans.
 #[design-data-model](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=schema_builder.htm&type=5)
</details>
<br>
<details><summary>
What is a #SF-object and the difference between #Standard-object and #Custom-object?
</summary>
It's like a table in the database, where columns are #fields and rows are #records.
- #Standard-object(s) are objects that are included with Salesforce. Common business objects like Account, Contact, Lead, and Opportunity are all standard objects.
- #Custom-object(s) are objects that you create to store information that’s specific to your company or industry. 
</details>
<br>
<details><summary>
What are #object-relationships and what types of relationship do you know?
</summary>
They're a #special-field-type that connect two objects together.
#Lookup-relationship let you 'look up' an object from another.
There's 2 types: #one-to-one and #one-to-many.

#Master-detail-relationship are 'tighter' relationship.
The master object controls certain behaviors of the detail object, like who can view the detail’s data.
The detail object highly dependent on the master. In fact, if a record on the master object is deleted, all its related detail records are deleted as well. 
In a #Master-detail-relationship the Master is always a #Standard-object and the detail is the #Custom-object.
The field is added always on the master side of the #Master-detail-relationship

### [Duplicate Management](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/sales_admin_duplicate_management?trailmix_creator_id=strailhead&trailmix_slug=prepare-for-your-salesforce-platform-app-builder-credential)

<details><summary>
What can I do to avoid duplicate data?
</summary>
Identify if there're duplicate records, using the Duplicate Management; it helps you and your sales teams quickly and easily manage duplicates for:
Business accounts
Contacts
Leads
Person accounts
Records created from custom objects
Accessible from #setup menu:
#Matching-rules
#Duplicate-rules

|What It Is|What It Defines|
|--- |--- |
|Matching rule|The matching criteria to identify duplicate records.Salesforce comes with three standard matching rules: one for business accounts; one for contacts and leads, and another for person accounts. Creating other matching rules is a cinch. We show you how Maria does it in the next unit.|
|Duplicate rule|When Salesforce engages matching rules and determines actions to take as it encounters duplicates.Depending on how you configure Duplicate Management, sales reps see an alert that they’re about to create a duplicate. Or your reps are blocked from creating the duplicate altogether. If your company started using Salesforce in Spring ’15 or later, we give you standard duplicate rules for business accounts, contacts, leads, and person accounts. If your company started using Salesforce in Winter ’15 or earlier, like Maria, you create the rules on your own, which is easy.|

You can create a #Report in order to check for duplicate records.
#Setup -> #Report-types -> ... -> select as #Primary-object the #Duplicate-record-items/#Duplicate-record-sets

### [Data Security](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/data_security?trailmix_creator_id=strailhead&trailmix_slug=prepare-for-your-salesforce-platform-app-builder-credential)

<details><summary>
Which are the levels of Data Access? 
</summary>

1. Organization -> auth users, password policies, location and hours login limits, trusted IP ranges (using #Profile)
2. Objects: setting permission on an object, from #Profile or #Permission-sets
3. Fields: restrict level access
4. Records: record access determines which individual records users can view and edit in each object they have access to in their profile. First ask yourself these questions:
- Should your users have open access to every record, or just a subset?
- If it’s a subset, what rules should determine whether the user can access them?

You control record-level access in four ways.
    - #Organization-wide-defaults
    - #role-hierarchy
    - #sharing-rules: found at #setup->#Security->#Sharing-Settings.
        You need to define a #Public-group
        - #Private
        - #Public-Read-Only
        - #Public-Read-write
        - #Controlled-by-Parent
    - #manual-sharing

![#security-map](/assets/images/2020-10-23-09-42-41.png)

Changes in Security can be tracked in the Audit section:
#setup -> #Security -> #View-Setup-Audit-Trail
Different view for profile from Dev Org and normal one.

* My Domain
* Centralized user account management
* User provisioning
* Identity Connect
* App Launcher

</details>

<details><summary>
Which are the language of Identity?
</summary>
#Language-of-Identity

1. #SAML: is the protocol that allow #SSO (When you want users to move seamlessly between Salesforce orgs and applications without logging in repeatedly). It's an #XML-based protocol
2. #OAuth 2.0 , allow secure data sharing between applications
3. OpenID Connect, #OpenID-Connect is protocol that adds an authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0 to enable secure exchange of user information.

One Term | That’s Easily Confused with This Term
---------|--------------------------------------
Authentication means who a person is. These days, authentication is often used as shorthand for authorization and authentication. | Authorization means what a person can do.
Protocol specifies the set of rules that enable systems to exchange information. Generally, the term protocol and standard are used interchangeably. | Standard is a specification, a set of industry practices that vendors agree to support. Often, a standard contains a protocol to specify how the companies implement the standard.
Username and password are what the user supplies to log in to a system. | Credentials are basically the same thing.
Single sign-on (SSO) enables a person to log in once and access other apps and services without logging in again. | Social sign-on enables a person to log in to an app using the credentials established with a social account like Google. That app accepts the Google credentials, and the user doesn’t have to create another account and password.
Identity provider is a trusted service that enables users to access other websites and services without logging in again. | Service provider is a website or service that hosts apps and accepts identity from an identity provider.

## [Screen Flow Distribution](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/screen_flow_distribution?trailmix_creator_id=strailhead&trailmix_slug=prepare-for-your-salesforce-platform-app-builder-credential)

<details><summary>
When Flow need an #Flow-action on a record instead of as default?
</summary>

Use Case | Example
---------|--------
The first element in the flow isn't a screen.The power of a flow is that it can do a lot of things behind the scenes, with the user none the wiser. But that can also make the flow a little bit dangerous, especially if it does those powerful, behind-the-scenes things before the first screen.| You built a flow that creates a task before displaying a screen to the user. If you put that flow on, say, the Account page, that flow would create a task every time a user loaded an account. That could result in lots of unnecessary tasks being created each day.
The flow isn't used often enough to be expanded by default. | You created a flow for your office managers to order new supplies. The office managers need to be able to access that flow easily, but they don't need to order supplies every day, so it would be a waste of space to put the flow directly on a record page.
</details>

<details><summary>
Where Flow can be added if needed on more records?
</summary>

If flow needs to be added from more than 1 record, you can add it to the #utility-bar,
It's only on all pages of 1 App.
</details>

<details><summary>
Can I add the Flow outside of Salesforce Org?
</summary>

1. Yes, You can add it to the a Salesforce Lightning #Community on:
    * Surveys
    * Registration forms
    * Interest forms
    * Quote generators, such as for a car they're selling
2. You can add it to a external app using #Lightning-out, but first enable Communities in Setup.

### [Reports & Dashboards for Lightning Experience](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/lex_implementation_reports_dashboards?trailmix_creator_id=strailhead&trailmix_slug=prepare-for-your-salesforce-platform-app-builder-credential)

<details><summary>
What are Report?
</summary>
A report is a list of records (like opportunities or accounts) that meet the criteria you define.
To get the data you need, you can filter, group, do math on records and  even display them graphically in a chart.
</details>

<details><summary>
What are Dashboard?
</summary>
A dashboard is a visual display of key metrics and trends for records in your org.
Each dashboard has a running user, whose security settings determine which data to display in a dashboard. If the running user is a specific user, all dashboard viewers see data based on the security settings of that user—regardless of their own personal security settings.
</details>

<details><summary>
What is a report type?
</summary>

Choosing a report type, you’re picking the records and fields you’ll be able to see in your report.

If you add a related object, here’s how you can configure a report type’s object relationship:
- Primary object with related object—Records
- Primary object with or without related object
</details>

<details><summary>
Which Report formats do you know?
</summary>

Report Format | Primary Use Case | Supported in Dashboards | Report Charts Supported | Bucket Fields** | Formulas** | Cross-Object Formulas**
--------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|------------|------------------------
Tabular | Make a list | :white_check_mark: |  | :white_check_mark:
Summary | Group and summarize | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | 
Matrix | Group and summarize, by row and column | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:
</details>

<details><summary>
What are dynamic dashboards?
</summary>

- With dynamic dashboards, each user sees the data they have access to without needing to create separate dashboards for each user.
- This means a single powerful dashboard can be used for multiple users in your company, because the logged-in user viewing the dashboard sees the data they should see, based on their security and sharing settings.
</details>

<details><summary>
How do you choose between a chart for your Report and a Dashboard?
</summary>

I reckon, if I have only one report I can even add a chart, I think, so that is going to give me the graphical representation I need.
</details>

<details><summary>
What do you consider before create a dashboard?
</summary>

I don't want to reinvent the well, I can decide to visit the [AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/) and look for a solution already there such as [#Salesforce CRM Dashboard](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000004g316EAA)
