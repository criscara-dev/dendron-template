# WoW
That my first note here.
I can't only regret this project didn't start last year, at least, when I start my Journal (non-daily)

## Buy or  not to buy: a car, and the future
Lucia wants to buy a car and, this is a big cost for us, now. I'm not sure about this.
I see more pros then cons, for security, move and travel the countryside, even short distance travels instead of paying Â£1.5 for each movement;
Insurance is not going to be a big cost but the car, per se, it does.
That's the big cons.
