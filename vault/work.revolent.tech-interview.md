1. Tell me about yourself
</summary>

## Overview Experience highlights
- I get interested in web development in order to build a website for myself and sell my art more than 10 years ago.
Basically, I learn HTML and CSS that is the basic foundation of web development. Since I’m passionate about learning I bought a book about JavaScript and JQuery that get me more into the Programming side of just ‘coding’.
I then joined a Bootcamp program and learnt both front-end with JS and back-end with C# and Java. I then got a job as a WordPress Developer and learn some PHP and MySQL databases even if I’ve been more oriented into front-end.
I discover React and fallen in love with building UI, I built some Apps and when looking for a position I discover Salesforce Platform and I saw a lot of potentialities while being contacted by Revolent.

- Values in Revolent:
Culture elements such as Revols for good (giving back)

User Setup
Security and Access

Platform Developer:

Data Modeling with how to find data with SOQL and SOSL, relationships
Logic and Processes: Declarative(Workflow rules, Approval Process, Lightning Flow: Process Builder and Flow Builder) Processes vs Programmatic development (Classes and Triggers and DML and testing)

Testing
Debug and Deployment tools
Governor Limits and Save Order of Execution
Visualforce Pages, Aura and LWC

After almost 3 years at ClickReturn and after I develop good technical expertise in WP, I spoke to my Director (owner) about my role and future directions/projects.

9. Describe a difficult work situation and what you did to overcome it
</summary>

I had a different viewpoint on a possible technical solution for a customer’s website with my designer.
I thought that since he was a designer he has no much say about that so we argue for a bit.
I then remember I was reading about self-development and cognitive bias so I tried instead to listen again his reasons propose as well mine and see what was good from both and reasoning together about pros and cons of both approaches and I suggested a Weighted Average Decision Matrix (WADM).
The basic idea here is to rationalize the decision-making process and not be lead by emotions.
