# Learning

## Silly example :smile:

### Learn fast something for quick usage:

- [ ] think about it on a piece of paper 
- [ ] read the documentation
ex for SF -> google sf docs or google bookmark
- [ ] if not enough watch videos or examples and save shortcuts:
ex. for SF ->  or  [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=)

##Â The Art of #google-search

- keep it simple and gradually add search terms
- use descriptive words
- use words website would use:
  ex. "apex testing" instead of "how can i test apex"
- use shortcuts: 
  ex. weather \<postcode> or time \<city>
  - search a specific fieltype:
    ex. apex cheatsheet filetype:pdf
- use tabs present on search result page to filter
- use quote to restrict result: 
  ex. "\<apex code snippets>"
- omit some result: \<searched world> -\<to omit>
  ex. mustang -cars
- search specific websites: \<searched world> site:\<website url>
  ex. apex snippets site:https://developer.salesforce.com/
- find a page that link to a specific page/result
  ex. link:"Tim Berners Lee" or link: link:cristiancaratti.co.uk
- find sites that are similar to others
    ex. related:amazon.co.uk
