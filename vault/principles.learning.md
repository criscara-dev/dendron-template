# Learning

## Silly example :smile:

### Learn fast something for quick usage:

- [ ] think about it on a piece of paper 
- [ ] read the documentation
ex for SF -> google sf docs or google bookmark
- [ ] if not enough watch videos or examples and save shortcuts:
ex. for SF ->  or  [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=)
