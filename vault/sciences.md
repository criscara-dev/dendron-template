## Statistics

Glossary

- data: output of a measurement device
- data type:
    - categorical
    - numeric
    The type is important to understand what type of data analysis to apply and which visualizations.
    - sample (some member of a group) vs population (all members of a group) vs case/anecdote (1 individual); all of them have different purpose
- visualization: in the plot:
    - bar plot (categorical)
    - histogram (numerical) ORDER of bars is important, in fact trying to use lines instead of bars...
    - pie chart (sum of all percentage = 100%)
- central tendency:
    - mean (average)
    - median (the value in the middle)
    - mode (the most common value)s
- measure of dispersion (of the variability around the mean): 
    - variance (distance from the mean) $\sigma^2$
    - standard deviation (the square root of variance) $\sigma$
-data normalization: in order to compare different data sources that may have a different scale, for instance...

- probability: numerical description of how likely an event is to occur or how likely it is that a proposition is true. It's a number between 0 and 1, where 0 is impossibility and 1 is certainty.

- Effect OF watching screens <span style="color:red">(independent var)</span> ON <span style="color:red">(dependent var)</span> eyes health.
- Model: equation that explains some feature in a dataset; x=  $\alpha$ y + $\epsilon$ (error)
- hypothesis:  a falsifiable claim that requires verification, from experiment or observational data, and that allow for predictions about future observation
- $$H_0$$ vs $$H_A$$ (hypothesis assumption)
- p-value

- outliers: generally don't count...(if they're noise) but what about a Black Swan?! COnsider which outlier we are talking about and if is important. That's more true when thinking about managing risk.
- Significances: 
    - statistical
    - theoretical
    - clinical
- Statistical tests:
    - T-test: simply as: Difference of means / standard deviations
    - Correlation
    - "A superset of T-test" ANOVA (analysis of variances): effect OF <span style="color:red">several categorical independent vars</span> ON <span style="color:red">1 numerical dependent var</span>
        > Use ANOVA when ind.vars are categorical
    - "A superset of Correlation" Regression:
        > Use Regression when ind.vars are continuous

Probability of outlier?! A new science?!
