What is collaboration?

Openness first
Bravery -> share your ideas
Transparency -> don't hide
Communication -> Zoom, emails, phone calls

From Kevin:

where is IBM bought Bluewolf to get into the SF environment.

Hybrid cloud solution: SF MuleSoft etc APIs, AI, intelligent WF (Watson)

2. Advices: mentor, think big, taking the risk, tell the customer (after talking with a customer, where they can getting addictives to SF? think bigger: they ask for a WF? propone something HUGE )

Are you a know name in the SF developer?
Do you have a Blog? followers etc.

==Design thinkings==

About Privacy and Security, I didn't see in your map for solution areas mention the SF Blockchain. Even if not quite big or 100% delivered, is IBM interested?
Did you see an increase in Salesforce Blockchain usage from Orgs and again which certification/experience would you recommend to help? Is IOT Industry for Health, mostly relevant as well.
