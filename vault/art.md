## Enough drawing:

- **Mechanical drawing course**: or how to learn the expression of form over a flat surface and as harold Speed said in his II Chapter on drawing, at the end:"Yet, however is advisable to let yourself go in artistic work, during your academic training let your aim be _**a searching for accuracy**_.
That's what my drawing course is about; not to learn the Art of great drawing or to become a master in line drawing, mass drawing etc. but to learn to draw as a way to learn to see so can you can then trasfer this 'skill' to painting as well.
In fact you can start to paint a great masterpiece without drawing lines for your subjects on a surface but still you need to be able to see and report the image in front of you with **accuracy**.
Advice: paint always what you see, not what you think you see. Now how...

    1. size-sight:
        - flat copy:
            part |what | to consider
            ----|----|---
            1   |shapes | just shapes
            2   |master copy | edges and tones
        - real 3D object / plaster cast 
            part |what 
            ----|----
            3   |simple  
            4   |complex

    2. comparative measurements (if you want to be ablt to draw any object without any compromise):
        > Always in comparative measurement establish a unit of measurement, a distance that does not vary in the subject and which all distances can be compared to.
    
        - flat copy:
            part |what | to consider
            ----|----|---
            1   |shapes | just shapes
            2   |master copy | edges and tones
        - real 3D object / plaster cast 
            part |what 
            ----|----
            3   |simple  
            4   |complex

    3. mass drawing (with tones)
    Basically get drawing from previous exercise(s) and:
        a. add the bed bug line
        b. add tone
    
    How to draw:
    1. add a vertical line (and possible an horizontal to setting the salient point in a draw
    2. block out the space occupied by the subject
    3. block in: in doing that, observe carefully the shape of the background as much as the object
    

- **artistic drawing**: move from do things from:
    what | meaning | result
    ---|---|---
    photo | no emotion/sentiment | mechanical, academic but accurate
    life drawing| emotion, connection, sentiment| artistic enphasis on essential features...
