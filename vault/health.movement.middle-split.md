## FULL Middle Split
My contribution:

1. Less in more (less exercises but the most effective; don't waste time with ones that are mildly effective)
2. no jargon, no nerdy explanation , clear english (detail in book/links...)
3. my skin in the game/experience and what I found not useful
4. use of partner, skeleton, mannequin
5. Skin in the game and I'm not a full time athlete BUT the goal is to achieve the splits and use them anytime* (almost...) so I prioritize strength over relax stretches. This require a lot more energy and willingness/determination.

### The book/App

### Who's this course for:
1. this course is recommended for intermediate/advance athletes, not really for beginners (it can be dangerous...).
You need to be already "quite flexible" (reference) since here I am not try to help to get in shape but to reach an extreme range of motion. Tht's not for the fancy of heart. 
2. You need to put the time... and take your time to get the result you want. If you want to ge the split, you need to practice the split. It's a lifestyle, a flexible lifestyle.

### Principles:
1. Arch your back / stick the butt out
2. Use hands to un-pinge yourself
3. deep wide squats

1. Pain is bad—it means you are hurting yourself and are making yourself weaker—so don't cause it.
2. TO increase your range of motion you have to move (for dynamic range of motion) or stay (for static range of motion) close to your maximum range.
3. To strengthen muscles at their full stretch, you need to tense them at that stretch.
4. Discomfort is bad—so you must find positions at which you can comfortably tense your or fully relax them (depending on what kind of stretches you do) without any discomfort.

### Fundamentals:
- Exercises:
1. Cossack Squats (side lunges)
Piriformis???
2. Seated good morning
3. Low pancake circle,bounces, floating or like [here](https://www.gotrom.com/products/pancake-middle-splits/categories/165512/posts/516518), basic explore this position
4. Wall middle-split
    - No weight: 30 reps
    - light weight / resistance band keep stretching
    - weight...
5. Pancake roll?!! as from Gymnastics bodies or [Straddle UP](https://www.gotrom.com/products/loaded-stretching/categories/165501/posts/526048), last one better probably
6. Floor pancake weighted and/or try to elevate legs...or try to stand from this position
7. Isometric: 3-5 sets of stretch and relax contractions, resting 3-5 minutes in between

Extras:
1. Adductor massage

What is Isometric Stretching?
</summary>
Isometric Stretching:
Tense strongly for a few seconds, relax, stretch within th
first second of relaxation, tense again. Keep this
cycle of tension and relaxation until you cannot stretch
any more without pain. Hold the last tension to strengthen
your muscles at their greatest stretch.
