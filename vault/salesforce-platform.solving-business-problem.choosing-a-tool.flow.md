Simple informations [here](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/flow-basics/meet-flow-builder?trail_id=build-flows-with-flow-builder) 
Recap:
Areas:
1. toolbox
2. canvas
3. button bar

Building blocks:
1. Elements: Each element is a step in the flow that instructs the flow on what to do. Can be broken down into:

    - logic
    - actions
2. Connectors: Connectors define the path that the flow takes as it runs. They tell the flow which element to execute next.
3. Resources: Resources are placeholders that you reference throughout your flow. For example, look up an accountâ€™s ID, store that ID in a variable, and later reference that ID to update the account
