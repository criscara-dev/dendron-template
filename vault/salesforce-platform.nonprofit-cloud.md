- [x] prepare web to Lead in my dev org and create form to embed in my WP website
- create a custom App
- add custom fields to Lead Stnd Obj 

- COMPANY DONATION: Fields needed for Company donation:
step 1: firstname, lastname, email, phone, location
step 2: 
how many desktops?
how many laptops?
how many monitors?
Any other equipment or comments?
How did you hear about the Turing Trust?
* Online search eg. Google
* Social media
* At an event eg. a conference
* Word of mouth
* Other: ______

==Schedule a call back?== may need more work as some sort of processes

I will create just a couples of custom fields to demo:
1. how did you hear...since is a checkbox and see how is working
2. how many laptops since is a normal text/number field
![](/assets/images/2020-12-01-19-30-40.png)

- [x] embed form into my WP website
- [x] fill up form and check my org
- [x] is working: the form arrived

==ISSUE need to make a multiselect?! on other...==

- INDIVIDUAL DONATION: fields needed for Individual donations:

Extra fields
- PCs - Please tell us the approximate number of desktops and / or laptops you are donating

==This is quite mental==
I think they need to simplify the forms;
1. tell first what you're accepting and excluding a priori what is not up to your standard
ex. Unfortunately...We don't accept those:
- OS (Operative Systems): Linux and other Unix-like (BSD etc.)
 
2. I'm still trying to do something but need to use picklists with multiselects, I mean:
basically custom picklist (controlling) -> to custom multi-select picklist (dependent)
![](/assets/images/2020-12-01-19-08-27.png)
which computer do you want to donate?
- laptops
- desktops
- tablets/phones

for each then:
- age acceptable:
3 y
3/30 y
>10 y
dont know (actually don't acceptable?)
- OS... select acceptable
Windows 7
...
MacOS 10
...
Android xxx
IOS xxx

- other accessories
HD
RAM
USB
monitors
...

- firstname, lastname, email, phone, location
- How did you hear about the Turing Trust?
* Online search eg. Google
* Social media
* At an event eg. a conference
* Word of mouth
* Other: ______

####Â basically on the Lead Object I created 2 new fields:
ex.
1. Device types (as controlled) checkbox
2. OS type (as dependent) multi-picklists
how to link them now?

- maybe 2 business processes/2 page layouts?!

issue on checklist value called "others" since cannot be dependent or can be created ad separate text field where user can enter other known where he heard about TuringTrust

==The big issue with both web to lead and  gforms is that those tools are used to create a Lead, not a lot of extra info on it, that is what the customer want.
Good practice will be to collect these data in future steps on Opportunity==
However

1. Business donations ok...
2. Individual? do we want to keeo this separate steps? Is till relevant that way
3. where do you want to redirect user after fill up the form? Do you have a thank you page? -> https://turingtrust.co.uk/
4. can you ask your IT guy to get the "reCAPTCHA API Key Pair" so I can add it to the form?

1. where do you want to redirect user after fill up the form? Do you have a thank you page? -> https://turingtrust.co.uk/ 
They may create a thank-you page to redirection

2. can you ask your IT guy to get the "reCAPTCHA API Key Pair" so I can add it to the form?
They don't need it, since they've already plugins for security on WP.com


3. 2 steps only for Individual forms

4. email confirmation only for businesses to confirm they've sent a request
email sent only if there's a business donation coming in to: Neil, Nicola ...
- less than 1GB
- 1GB or more
- not known


add to Busi mobile...to form non create new
picklist only for hearing about us

Stuart questions:

City or Company city?
