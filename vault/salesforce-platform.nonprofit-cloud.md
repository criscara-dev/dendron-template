==ISSUE need to make a multiselect?! on other...==

- INDIVIDUAL DONATION: fields needed for Individual donations:

Extra fields
- PCs - Please tell us the approximate number of desktops and / or laptops you are donating

==crazy mental==
I think they need to simplify the forms;
1. tell first what you're accepting and excluding a priori what is not up to your standard
ex. Unfortunately...We don't accept those:
- OS (Operative Systems): Linux and other Unix-like (BSD etc.)
- 
2. I'm still trying to do something but need to use picklists with multiselects, I mean:
basically custom picklist (controlling) -> to custom multi-select picklist (dependent)
