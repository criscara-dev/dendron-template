==The first step to successful technical project management is understanding your client’s business and technology needs.==

1. Design session:

checklist
- [ ] What problems do customers/clients confront?
- [ ] What privacy challenges and security threats do you face?
- [ ] Are there policies we need to follow or develop for project success (including information security policies, or policies related to secure coding practices?)
- [ ] What risks could affect the project (including both security and non security risks)? Are there certain technical key performance indicators (KPIs) you want to meet, such as increasing system performance by 100%?
- [ ] Where do you plan to be in the future? For example, the end goal may be to have a system that is both simple to use and versatile enough for a wide range of functions and features.

2. Validating the Project Proposal
Once you’ve answered these initial questions during the design phase, it’s now time to validate whether your proposed approach is feasible.

- Scope: In some projects, especially those that use an agile methodology, the key to defining the scope is to define a minimally viable product (MVP)
- Schedule
- Cost

### Monitor Project Progress
Finding Solutions to Recurring Issues
The best project managers recognize gaps as risks to the project, and work to mitigate the potential impact of these risks. Projects are a discovery-driven process, often uncovering new customer needs and identifying critical issues not previously disclosed. Projects also encounter unexpected events, such as team members resigning, budgeted resources suddenly changing, the organization becoming unstable, and newer technologies being introduced. You as a technical project manager need to properly identify and manage these risks throughout the project lifecycle.

KPIs for budget include actual cost (AC), cost variance (CV), and return on investment (ROI), among others
