Fundamental Counting Principle (#fundamental-counting-principle or #rule-of-product)
</summary>
It's a rule used to count the total number of possible outcomes in a situation. It states that if there are nn ways of doing something, and mm ways of doing another thing after that, then there are n\times n × m ways to perform both of these actions. In other words, when choosing an option for n and an option for m, there are n\times n × m different ways to do both actions.
