to do
- [x] [Superbadge](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/superbadges/superbadge_lightning_platform_app_builder?trailmix_creator_id=strailhead&trailmix_slug=prepare-for-your-salesforce-platform-app-builder-credential)

## Notes:
I have to leave the program about programming because it was taking enormous amount of time from ma main MUSTS.
I decided to stop it and focus on what is most important now.
Sometime you have to decide and select things to do and not to do.
I'l leaving this interesting topic for a sabbatic 2 weeks holiday where I can dive into it full-time, like a workshop.
It make more sense view this way. Davide reckon as well to filling up gap with dedicated short but continuous time.

I finally completed the App Customization Superbadge
