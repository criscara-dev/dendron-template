- Prime the canvas with rabbit skin glue air dried and rabbit skin glue jelly with spatula and it will be absorbed nicely.
We use rabbit skin glue 'cause canvases deteriorates, get brown... rabbit offer a barrier  and a seal for the oil going toward the canvas etc.
- Don't put anything on your back canvas. Canvas not glue we are talking about.
Otherwise the canvas will contract too much...that's the idea.
- prime gesso on panel; birch playwood is maybe the best?!
- portrait linen ground doesn't grip well colors on the canvas and after many years the painting can crack even faster...

- Sun bleach the oil... nothing new to me.

- shellac on a base to avoid to much absorbent canvas

- Gambar varnish can be removed easyly... (from Gamblin)
