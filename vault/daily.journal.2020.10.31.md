Today I just want to learn Node and I'll do basically just that, write an email to Davide and look for a Mentor.

Just found this #mentor: [Warren Walters](https://salesforcementor.teachable.com/p/salesforce-mentoring), his [website](https://www.salesforcementor.com/training/mentoring)
and why not, I can even use [SF Mentorship Program](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazerconnect/mentorship)
[For finding interesting opportunities or jobs](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazerconnect)
