## The Data model/Schema

- Dan Abramov Just JavaScript course:
    - Lesson 2

    Let’s recap what we know so far:
    There are values, and then there’s everything else. We can think of values as different things “floating” in our JavaScript universe. They don’t exist inside our code, but we can refer to them from our code.
    There are two categories of values: there are Primitive Values, and then there are Objects and Functions. In total, there are nine separate types. Each type serves a specific purpose, but some are rarely used.
    Some values are lonely. For example, null is the only value of the Null type, and undefined is the only value of the Undefined type. As we will learn later, these two lonely values are quite the troublemakers!
    We can ask questions with expressions. JavaScript will answer to us with values. For example, the 2 + 2 expression is answered with 4.
    We can inspect the type of something by wrapping it in a typeof expression. For example, typeof(4) is the string value "number".
