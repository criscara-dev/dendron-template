### #Shortcuts:

Code -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts

- option+arrow(up/down): to move the line up/down all highlated block/line
- cmd+l: open lookup
- cmd+shift+l: lookup schema (.yml)
- cmd+shift+p: open the search #refactor (from here)
- cmd+shift+r: copy a reference
- cmd+option+v: paste image
- right click: markdown help
- cmd+shift+s: create a scratch note
- ^ + space: suggestion

### Thought about methods for taking notes - How to make hierarchies...
- How to create 'meaninful' keywords
Ask yourself: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note? How and when will I use this idea?
Ex. NO #productivity YES #how-to-journal #how-to-get-feedback
- #amoeba-pattern as a way to create notes and structure?

### Deploy Dendron:

- [x] install ruby 
- [x] install Jekyll 
- [x] setting up environment (run: bundle install from Terminal from Docs dir) 
- [ ] Publishing Our Notes?
I want a partial publish* (build pod with command Build Pod 'Dendron: Build Pod' from within cmd+shift+p
- [ ] comd: *bundle exec jekyll serve* and check on http://localhost:4000/
- [ ] last step: from terminal run: 'bundle exec jekyll serve'

 *to publish only: 
 - root
    - book
    - Principles
        - work
        - Life
    - mental model

Basically I'm missing:
1. the preview. (first set files to publish)
2. create a *pod*
3. re-push to master/main
4.
