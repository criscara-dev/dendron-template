## Kathryn meeting
The purpose of these drop-ins sessions is so address any questions you may have on certifications (resources, study groups, exam booking), request for training and any other business

 

Attendance is optional but we recommend dropping in every 2 weeks so we can touch base on your progress towards your next certification

 

If you have just returned from client site, please attend the next available session so we can update you on recent developments

 

Thanks,
