## Thoughts
yesterday night with Lucia, at our dinner anniversary we had a great conversation, we talk about many things we didn't speak for a long time.

We agreed we should do this at least 3 times a week; 
After dinner just sit down, and talk about something we'd like to discuss with our partner.
