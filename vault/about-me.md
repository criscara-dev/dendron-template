# User-Guide on Me

What I know something about
- How I think about things
- Common mistakes I make in my interaction with you:
- My expectations to you
- What frustrates me
- How to reach out to me
- How to give me feedback
- Tips from others who have worked with me (ideally co-workers will eventually add to this)

and
what you value
how you look at problems
what your blind spots
areas of growth are
and how to build trust with you.

## Programming languages skills:

I consider myself an ==expert-generalist==. In no particular order, I am a teacher, a mover, an artist, a web developer.
I work primarily with Salesforce, but I am eager to learn about all aspects of programming with the idea to develop products and services that make people’s lives easier and more productive.

Product management:

Template: A User Guide To Working With Cristian

Introduction
Why are you writing this user guide? What do you hope will be the result of writing and sharing this?

- Hi, Cristian here. I'm happy to be here
I’m writing this user guide to give you a 'map' about me, my values, my ways, to growth a beneficial collaboration. It'll be great if you can do the same and share it with me and all our 'entourage'.


How I view success
What does being good at your job mean to you? What are your values that underpin your understanding of success?

How I communicate
How have other people described your communication style? What have you gotten feedback about in the past? How should others interpret what you do or say? What do you struggle to express? How do you like to stay in sync with others (email, chat, in-person)? What’s your availability outside of work hours? 

Things I do that may annoy you
I don't think multitasking is efficient, and I'm not a multitasker...
What’s the cause of misunderstandings that you’ve had in the past? What are some things about your style that other people have given you critical feedback on? What quirks or mannerisms might unintentionally annoy a different personality type?  

What gains and loses my trust
What actions can a person take to gain your trust? Conversely, what triggers you? 

My strengths
What do you love to do and are good at? What can you help others with?

My growth areas
What are your blind spots? What are you working on? What can others help you with?


Additional Optional Sections:
What I expect from people I manage
What do you consider a stellar job for someone who reports to you? What do you consider a mediocre or bad job? What’s unique about your expectations that may differ from other managers?

How I give and receive feedback
What is your philosophy around feedback? What can others expect in receiving feedback from you? How would you prefer to receive feedback from others?

## what motivate me? (my values)
Overall those are my 5 top values:
1. Autonomy; I love the freedom to determine the nature of my work and time without significant direction from others, TLDR; -> flexibility
2. Predictability and structure; Yes, I like work well organized and when tasks don’t change much overtime.
3. Making a difference; I want my work having a positive impact.
4. Problem solving; I love solving problems and identifying solutions.
5. Adventure; Exploring and experiencing new things to improve my creativity and innovation potential



## My career goals
I like either to work remotely or in a Office, ideal would be a mix if I'm living in the same City as my Company's Offices are.
In the short term I'd like to learn better Apex but in the long term I'd like to be a better computational thinker and learn some other programing languages: Assembly, to understand how computer machines works, an imperative programming language such as Python, improve my knowledge of a functional programming language as JavaScript/Node.JS and finally learn something about Machine Learning language as PyTorch.

## Where I want to be in the long term
 Using data-driven decisions/tools to Help Companies choose the right technologies to achieve their goals.(connecting the dots)

 ## jobseeker checklist
- [ ] Have a professional headshot taken
- [ ] Update social media profiles: Twitter, LinkedIn, Trailhead profile
- [ ] Update resume
- [ ] Get resume reviewed (by a professional or perhaps friends, family)
- [ ] Craft an elevator pitch
- [ ] Research prospective companies
- [ ] Follow companies you are interested in on Twitter, LinkedIn

## My 30" Pitch
I’m an experienced web developer, recently certified as Salesforce Admin and Developer looking to move into a consulting role as a Developer
I love helping clients to optimize their use of Salesforce and pursue new goals.
I’ve been grown up in the mountains and I've been deeply in contact with nature since I was a kid, and I want to work for an organization that’s environmentally focused.
I have only 6 months experience into the Salesforce Platform but since I started, I've already earn 2 Certifications, > 100 Trailhead badges and some Superbadges.
