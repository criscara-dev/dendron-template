 #George-Hotz: if you're good solving problems, you finish stumble upon someone already did it and from there...
 the only way to learn programming from anyone I've ever met who can program well, learned it all the same way: they have something they want to do it and then they tried to do it and then they wee like: oh well...
 that's how you learn, you just keep pushing on a project
 You want to learn programming -> go to program.
