## Should do

Morning

Evening 2020-11-28 20:28
- [ ] taking notes for my first book on Longevity and decided to keep working on my daily fast of 16/18-8-6 started today.
Actually I've been fasting for at least 2 years now but not everyday or in a row.
- I decided to from today and because it's an experiment none has done before and I'll keep track for the coming years.
- Plus every month I'll try 1 day full fasting
- every 3 months: 1 week fasting as 1 meal a day and trying last 2 days as full fast (48hrs)
