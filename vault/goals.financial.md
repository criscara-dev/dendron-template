Becoming millionaire following my Personal trading Academy

[DCA = dollar cost averaging](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/dollar-cost-averaging-dca-explained)
Basically divide your bet into many chunks instead of trade all Account at once:
instead of buy Â£100 at once set 4 buy prices based on your expectations...and eventually change/cancel your orders.

### Candles

Heikin Ashi: give more the idea of the trend
Renko:

Normal Candle, stick to this for the moment

## Indicators

RSI and Stochastic, they show how much oversold or overbought a coin is.
if oversold... it's time to buy!

## 3Commas

**Heikin Ashi** candles: shows the strength of the trend and are more fluid

**Renko** use ATR average true range

==the candles that you choose affect the indicators...==

## Account Builder

> for A/B trading the trick to grow the account quickly is split the total amount that you want to invest in only 2 CHARTS.
Basically instead of just 10% of the account, 50%

> for AB trading don't look at ask/bid prices... on the right side
