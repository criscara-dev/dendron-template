## Should do

- [x] non-profit web 2 lead - individual users
- [x] meeting
- [x] non-profit web 2 lead - individual users
- [x] 15 questions

What can be done better

- steps buttons... how?
- instead of .style.display/visibility = "..." I can create a component tag:

```javascript

const mobile = `<div>
// component html tags
</div>
`
```
and then display them based on the page.
What do you think?
At least I can avoid weird spacing since I'm appending to the same place elements that I need to display.
