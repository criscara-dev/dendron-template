## Front Split course

### your Whys
Forget this:
> "Think of your greatest range of motion on the splits in the same way you’d think of your max on back squats, or the hardest trick you can do. You can only do it a couple times before you can’t do it anymore, and you can only do it when you’re fresh and after a long warm up."
No! You need to be able to perform the split on demand, no warm up.
Otherwise your methods are ineffective.
To old to achieve the split?
Really, it's all relative.
People have different story and genetics and habits...
I could generally say that if you’re a sedentary person, you would be facing increased difficulty in achieving full splits at any age. If you’ve been active but have never trained flexibility directly, then you would probably be facing increased difficulty from 50s?!.
Younger you are easier it is even thought I recommend this type of training from the age of 18, since children have a different body, bones etc.I don't want to be more specific but I firmly believe that from an adult perspective, it's easier to rely on your strenght that on your natural fisiology.

### Principles:
1. The greatest and fastest gains are made by resetting the nervous control of muscle tension and length.
2. Special strength exercises can stimulate the muscle fibers to grow longer and elongate the fibrous connective tissue associated with the muscle.
3. measure your progress: you need to make a _Split Journal_ or bought mine;
> You need to measure to see your progress: count set, reps and rest.
4. barbell strategy:a void the middle: O-------o
(stretch light always) -------- (train strength 2 times a week very hard)

### Sequences of stretches in a workout:
1. dynamic
2. static active
3. isometric (rest enough between series)
4. relaxed

### EXTRAS and FAQs:
Flexibility depends on emotional state and increase during excitement

### References:
- Stretching scientifically :Tom Kurz
> Thomas Kurz’s book popularized isometric stretching methods. His book is a classic. If you want to read about the science of what is actually happening to your body when you stretch, the nervous system and muscular cells for example, and how to use that knowledge to
optimize flexibility training, then you will love this book. This book was the most influential and important flexibility book I read.
