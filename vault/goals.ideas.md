 ### About RenArt

zeitgest...
I'm starting with a blank canvas and seeing where it goes, I DONT predefine my expectations or try to design a path that will fulfil a purpose and communicate a message. It's a creative/technical experimentation.
But there's a message as well, and where it exist, there surely is a meaning.

The Bible, the Ark, Isle of the deads, Turner, Star maps, Industrial city, Stargate, the past history, Earth, Mars, landscapes, Pire Reis, Et In Arcadia Ego, Turin Syndon , Stendhal effect, night launch rocket, Hammuraby, rock engraving (the Spaceman), reflection, Mars sunset, Comets

Reference: Old Master, ornulf opdahl, G. Richter, 

artists, which inspire my work
I have not special reserved models of famous painters or art styles, but I like the harmonic colorfield paintings from Rothko, abstract paintings from G.Richter from the 80s to 90s, reduced paintings from Ryman, Rauschenberg (white paintings), Soulages, Hartung, Erb and some works from de Stael.

statement
My work focuses on texture and abstract color(-field) compositions. Most based on traditional media and techniques, such as canvas, paper, timber board, painted with acrylic and mixed media. Besides this, I create also intermedial artworks, this means analog paintings are used for digital modifying process to create a total new artwork.
Discreet colors, surface structures and textures of the environment and nature inspire me, creating new abstract compositions or restructured textured paintings. One focus of my work are reduced paintings in color and texture. The works reflect my attitude of life and of painting 'less is more'. In times of overload of visual impressions, I try to send the viewer on a journey of discovery across the painting surface and sensitive him for the few and less in color, structures, cracks and textures. “Material, color and composition, a perpetual challenge to create something new “
