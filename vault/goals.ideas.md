 ### About RenArt

zeitgest...
I'm starting with a blank canvas and seeing where it goes, I DONT predefine my expectations or try to design a path that will fulfil a purpose and communicate a message. It's a creative/technical experimentation.
But there's a message as well, and where it exist, there surely is a meaning.

The Bible, the Ark, Isle of the deads, Turner, Star maps, Industrial city, Stargate, the past history, Earth, Mars, landscapes, Pire Reis, Et In Arcadia Ego, Turin Syndon , Stendhal effect, night launch rocket, Hammuraby, rock engraving (the Spaceman), reflection, Mars sunset, Comets


artists, which inspire my work:
I don't have a specific model that I follow but I'm often referring to the Old and New Masters such as Turner, from the contemporary Ornulf Opdahl, G. Richter for the abstract paintings, ideas from ...

Themes: Ancient History, History of Art, Syncretism that often come as abstract landscapes (with objects).


statement
My work is mainly focuses on texture and abstract color/pattern compositions. It's mostly based on traditional media and techniques, such as canvas, board, painted with oils, egg tempera, acrylic or mixed media.
Besides this, I create also Digital artworks, this means analog paintings are used for digital modifying process to create a total new artwork.
I'm inspired from surface textures of structures, objects and  landscapes. From here I'm creating new abstract compositions or restructured textured paintings. 
One focus of my work are reduced paintings in color and texture.
The works reflect my attitude of life and of painting 'less is more'.

In times of overload of visual impressions, I try to send the viewer on a journey of discovery and re-discovery* across the painting surface and sensitive him for the few and less in color, structures, cracks and textures. â€œMaterial, color and composition, a perpetual challenge to create something new"
