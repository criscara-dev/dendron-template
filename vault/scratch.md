- Using a piece of software enable you to be like a PhD (or more) at some degree for certain tasks

- Read on Brilliant this morning about Amazon system using chaos/random to store things in wharehouses and recover them...
I think the same is for learnings.
I mean: I learn stuff from a lot of different sources and then is easier to recover them (from your brain perspective)
