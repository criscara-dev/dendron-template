# Random Thoughts

#Zettelcasten
> Sönke Ahrens "Learning would be not so much about saving information, like on a hard disk, but about building connections and bridges between pieces of information. It is about making sure that the right cues trigger the right memory, about how we can think strategically to remember the most useful information when we need it.

## Thought about data
Can I actually use Data to drive smart decisions?
Data->information->knowledge->insights-> wisdom?
Is the data enough?
Is the right data?

The idea is that sentiment analysis should find connections, not only keywords but in context then.
How is sentiment analysis achieved in Salesforce? Can we use phone recording(-> to transcribe  to text) and emails to get insights in what the customer really want and theirs intentions?
What is positive sentiments then?

- Using a piece of software enable you to be like a PhD (or more) at some degree for certain tasks

- Read on Brilliant this morning about Amazon system using chaos/random to store things in wharehouses and recover them...
I think the same is for learnings.
I mean: I learn stuff from a lot of different sources and then is easier to recover them (from your brain perspective)

But every job posting seemed to be senior, senior, senior. And Steven James, who is a colleague at Salesforce, and I worked with on an open source project as part of my transition, his advice was that a lot of engineering managers, they don’t want to keep people from applying that are overqualified. So in other words, putting a job rec out with the senior title casts the widest net for engineering managers, and then they can take that pool.

You can find this on your statement. We convert your annual simple rate into a daily rate by dividing it by the number of days in a year (365). We then apply the daily rate and add it to the amount you owe each day. For example, if you owed £1,000 and had a simple rate of 20%, the amount you would pay in interest for one year would be 20% of £1,000, which is £200. This amount would then be divided by the number of days in a year: £200 ÷ 365, which is 55p. The interest is added to your account every day, so the following day you would pay interest on a balance of £1,000.55. This is known as compound interest, it means you pay interest on the interest you’re charged, not just on the things you buy. If you pay off your balance in full each month, you won’t pay any interest. You also won’t pay interest on any late payment, fees or returned payment we add to your balance.

> Didn't You Say We Can Learn Anything?
Yes! I said that Anyone, Anywhere can learn Anything. But that doesn't mean that we don't have things we are better suited to than others. With our limited time, our job is to figure out what to pursue based on our existing skills, and the skills we can develop. Sometimes we have to know when to turn around and pick the right path in order to use our resources efficiently.
I'm 33 now. I probably don't have a shot at becoming a gold medallist in gymnastics unfortunately :(
